    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the factors that influence housing prices is a central problem in real estate analytics, urban planning, and financial decision-making. In this project, we analyze a comprehensive dataset of residential home sales from Ames, Iowa, originally compiled by Dean De Cock and widely used as a benchmark in predictive modeling. The dataset contains detailed information on the physical characteristics of each property, including structural attributes (such as overall material quality, number of rooms, and total living area), lot features, building type, utilities, basement and garage conditions, as well as sale timing and transaction details. The data is pubicly available on kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a predictive model for SalePrice, the market value of each property, using the rich set of features provided. With more than 70 variables spanning numeric measurements, categorical classifications, and quality ratings, the dataset allows us to explore relationships between housing characteristics and price at a granular level. This also provides an opportunity to apply the full workflow of statistical learning: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation."

    "## Assumptions About our Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are assuming that the data was collected with accuracy. Additionally, although there may be some measurement error, we are assuming that these errors are not systematically related to the sale price. Furthermore, we are assuming that each of the home sales are independent of each other. Since the data is observational, it is important to note that we cannot assume causality from our analysis. For logistic regression, we separated the sales prices into three categories (low/medium/high). We are assuming that these categories are a meaningful representation of the sale prices. "
